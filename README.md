## Run Dino Run

This project is inspired by the classic Google Dino Run which we used to know as a game which is played when there is no Wi-Fi signal and we try to open Google (link ->chrome://dino/).

The game was made in JavaScript in Visual Studio and it was tested using LiveServer (Visual Studio extension) and can be played on multiple devices (meaning diffrent screen dimensions).

The assets are .png images which were edited so that the game has more color, controversial to the classic white-gray pattern of the original game.

Note: There are not any bird obstacles, only cactus!
